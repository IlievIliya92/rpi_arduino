# Arduino FreeRTOS POSIX Webserver

The main idea of this feature is to provide direct connectivity
between a remote client and the device hosting the Arduino board.
The server is currently developed under
a freeRTOS posix simulator so it can be ported lately to multiple platforms
that could support the TCP/Ip stack.
